    <h1>Profile</h1>
    <p class="class-p-center">I am currently studying for certificate IV in Information Technology Software Programming
        at TAFE. I have built a solid foundation of a couple of languages and other processes that are used in Software
        programming. I have developed a passion for programming during my education and I am very keen to gain workplace
        experience. Previously I have worked in the construction industry as a Carpenter for 15 years and have also
        managed my own mortgage broking business for 5 years. I come from very different occupations as I have decided
        to work in a field I am passionate about. The experience I have gained in my previous work however will help me
        in this new career. I am hardworking, very dedicated and focused. I am loyal and work very well in a team.<br>
        <br>My short-term goal is to gain hands on experience in a software developer position whilst I’m still
        finishing my Cert 4 in Information technology Programming. With a solid foundation in C#, Python and SQL,
        I am equipped to contribute to software development projects effectively.<br><br>
        In the long term I hope to work in a software development role.
