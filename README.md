# Resume-Website
This is a personal project I created to have an online resume website. Using the skills I have learned at TAFE and personal research I was able to create the HTML / CSS/ JAVAscript website.
For the animations, I went through Code Pen to get an idea of whatâ€™s possible and refactored some programs from their database.

For the opening animation with the mountains, I used this program https://codepen.io/creativeocean/pen/qBbBLyB with this program.
I decided to create my artwork for it in Adobe Illustrator.

For the Header animation, I used the foundation of the opening animation and applied it to the Header title but I decided to add some time delays to certain aspects.

For the glowing link buttons, I used the program https://codepen.io/gayane-gasparyan/pen/jOmaBQK and changed the styling to suit my webpage.
